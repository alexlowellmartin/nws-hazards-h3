# Terminology

Watch
: A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain.
: It is intended to provide enough lead time so that those who need to set their plans in motion can do so.


Warning
: A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring.
: A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or property.


Advisory
: The expected weather condition has a pretty good chance of occurring, even a likely chance of occurring, but typically an advisory is used for less severe type of weather conditions.
: A Wind Advisory might be issued or a Freezing Rain Advisory issued instead of a High Wind Warning or an ice Storm Warning.
